# Lab 17 Dina Ayoub

Code for resizing from [Amazon docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-s3-example.html)

## How to use my lambda

You upload an image to the bucket "img-uploads-bucket" and then you will find the resized version of it in the "img-uploads-bucket-resized"

## Issues

I really had too many to remember. The biggest challenge was that the google result i worked from for a long time was dated, so i couldn't find the things they kept referring to.
